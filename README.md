## Description

Data and technology can be powerful tools for understanding and improving the democratic process. Instead of weaponising these tools to produce unfair advantages, driving mistrust and disenfranchisement, the data community can also do the opposite. This hackathon isn't "The Great Hack", but it will be a hack, it will be great, and it will be using data for good.

Why do some people exercise their right to vote whilst others stay at home? In an era of contentious discourse and political scandals, how can we restore democratic faith and trust in our elected representatives?

In this hackathon, hosted by [Newspeak House](https://www.nwspk.com/), we present a series of challenges and datasets compiled by civic tech organisations working to upgrade democracy for the digital age. We will provide working examples, open ended challenges as well as a Kaggle-style prediction competition, and plenty of support if this is your first data hackathon!
