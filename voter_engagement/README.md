# PyData 2019 Democracy Hackathon: Voter Engagement


## Description
The goal of this challenge is simple, find a hack to improve voter turnout.

There are some existing projects like [where do I vote](https://wheredoivote.co.uk/), that make the process of finding your polling station easy and many companies have tools that allow individuals to promote that they have voted with the intention of encouraging others to do so. So here's a few idea's to get you started:

### Postal vote uptake
Beyond any distinguishable demographic, postal voters have the highest turnout rates, averaging 85% accross the country. A [study undertaken in the early 2000's](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/08/localgovernment.voterapathy) by the government showed the improvements for local elections (which have a lower turnout generally) were even greater, and for a period the Electoral Comission's official advice was to make postal voting the default for local and regional elections. Moving to a postal vote can also protect those disenfranchised by ID checks, which are not a requirement when voting by post.

You can find a copy of the standard postal vote from [here](https://www.yourvotematters.co.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/222454/Postal-vote-application-form.pdf). The biggest obstacle to adoption is the effort it takes to submit - either by post or scanned than emailed (a signature is required during registration which is matched against a signature you provide when voting). Success here is promoting or making it easier to sign up for postal votes.

### The easy campaign
Can we make it easier for the civic minded to promote voting to people they know? Platforms like 'Facebook' now have an I voted button, and [they say it's good for turnout](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/15/facebook-says-it-voter-button-is-good-for-turn-but-should-the-tech-giant-be-nudging-us-at-all). It could be a tool to share information like when do I vote and where. Even if people already have this information, being reminded improves the likelihood they'll turnout - you can't encourage somone to vote too much!
